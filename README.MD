# Shoesting Budgeting App
A web application that allows you to keep track of monthly expenses all in one place. 

This is a group project for the UCSD Coding Bootcamp requiring our group to design and build our first full-stack web application using the MVC paradigm, creating our own server-side API, adding user authentication, and connecting to a database.

## Description
**Creating a budget is not always simple. To keep track of your finances every month, you might use a notepad and calculator, an Excel spreadsheet, check multiple apps, or just hope for the best.** 

**For those who are ballin' on a budget, but still want to make sure they feel like they have their life together, we created the Shoestring app to keep it simple.**

## User Story
"As a consumer who wants to monitor my income, savings, debts and spending, I want to be able to calculate budgets for my personal finances so that I can feel more confident about my financial decisions to spend and save wisely."

## Requirements
We were given the following requirements. Projects must:

* Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.


* Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.


* Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.


* Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.


* Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.


* Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.


* Include authentication (express-session and cookies).


* Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.


* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).


* Have a polished UI.


* Be responsive.


* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).


* Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

  
## Process
**What was your motivation?**
Our motivation was to build a web app using the concept from a monthly budgeting spreadsheet that Hayley created and uses every month to keep track of her income, bills, and what's leftover. 
  
**Why did you build this project?**
We built this project to serve as a practical and useful tool for ourselves and other users.

**What problem does it solve?**
This allows users to solve the problem of not being able to see a clear view of their finances every month and removing day to day guesswork.

**What did you learn?**
We learned a lot about routing, databases and tying it all into the front end.

**What challenges did you encounter?**
We encountered challenges with sending data back and forth from the front end.
